                    <p class="testa"><i>This place is kinda hard to find but definitely worth it. Clint took great
                            care of my
                            M3, was very professional, and extremely knowledgeable.
                            Clint gave me a very reasonable up front quote and I was able to watch while he did my
                            exhaust
                            install. I don’t trust very many people to work on my new car but was more than happy to see
                            how
                            well he took care of it. Would definitely recommend.</i>

                        <i>Very very efficient, accurate and professional with their service. They even called to check
                            and see if everything was working. Highly recommend their services. </i>

                        <i>I’d had my Mini into a couple of shops for alignment and they couldn’t get it right.
                            Clint
                            figured out the problem and got it perfect. I needed some other deferred maintenance work
                            done
                            and it was done right, quickly, with a fair price and no oversell. I’m very satisfied and I
                            see
                            where all these 5 star ratings come from. By appointment but well worth the wait. For those
                            of
                            you who are reading this testimonial I would like to say from the get-go that these guys are
                            just short of being able to walk on water. If you do not avail yourselves of their services
                            you
                            are only hurting yourself.</i>

                        <i>First impression: I scoured the web for Miata freaks in Houston and ran into many positive
                            and no negative references to Gas Head Motorworks, Clint and/or Sam. OK, it’s worth the
                            effort for me to drive in from Montgomery with my new convertible top in the trunk and check
                            ‘em out. I turn them loose and go get a bite to eat. When I get back I notice a screw
                            missing from one of the sun visor brackets and, pointing to a similar screw in another
                            location on the car and ask, “If you happen to have an extra one of these screws lying
                            around would you put it in my sun visor bracket? I see I’m missing one.”
                            Clint (without pausing): “You don’t want that screw in your sun visor bracket, you want a
                            pan head screw. That’s a flat head screw.”
                            When was the last time you were in the presence of a someone so thoroughly steeped in the
                            details of their profession?
                            Needless to say the top replacement was without flaw. I soon returned for their Maximus Tune
                            up/Check out. Their work transformed the characteristics of the car from “slop and flop” to
                            “snick and click”. Everything was tight and true and it was difficult for me to keep the
                            grin off my face.</i>

                        <i>My 2000 Miata has found a new garage, when it needs repairs. Clint took my car in, replaced
                            the
                            timing belt and other repairs that were needed to keep it running brand new and he was done
                            the
                            following day. In by 10 am Wednesday, done by the end of the day Thursday! Picked the car up
                            and
                            the engine was clean, even more clean than the day it rolled out of the plant. Beyond
                            reasonable
                            pricing and very professional. Thanks Clint, the car works great.</i>

                    <i>There is a reson you will see nothing less than five stars as ratings for Gas Head. They earn
                        every star. I heard rave reviews for several years from all the other Lotus owners who had taken
                        their cars to Gas Head, but had not taken my Elise there because their location is just not
                        convenient for me. Now I am a convert. These guys are the real deal. They know what they are
                        doing. They are honest. They will tell you what they can do and when they can do it and be
                        absolutely right most of the time. They will also advise you what they think you should not do
                        if they think it is not good value for you. They care about each car as if it was their own and
                        their lives depended on things being done right. If I could give a higher rating I would.</i>
